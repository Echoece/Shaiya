**contents**
* ct file that stops all notice functions from injecting the database (/warning credit: Cups)
* revised version of shen's item mall solution for ep5 servers along with the source code
* ps_game that has been reversed to have no custom dll injections for those that don't want an item mall
* possible solution for capes being enchanted via client modification (probably packet injection)
* various cheat engine files that either solve bugs and exploits or add simple modifications to the game

**notes**
* the ps_game has an extra code section beginning at address 04096000 that can be used for code caves ^_^
